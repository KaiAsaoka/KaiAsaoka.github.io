### Full-Stack Software Developer Intern

From May to December 2025, I completed an 8-month co-op at D-Wave Quantum Systems in Burnaby, BC, where I worked as a full-stack software developer on cryogenic control systems for quantum computers.

I developed a scalable asynchronous Python server for cryogenic fridge control, interfacing with 10+ SCPI and Modbus devices via a REST API to automate test procedures and log telemetry to an InfluxDB time-series database. On the front-end side, I designed 3+ UI applications in Plotly Dash for remote monitoring, real-time data visualization, and control of server operations.

I also implemented unit tests using Pytest and Mock framework, increasing test coverage and refactoring the codebase for maintainability. Beyond my core responsibilities, I contributed to the open source [PVAccess for Python (P4P)](https://github.com/epics-base/p4p) library on GitHub, extending the NTTable normative type to support flexible field initialization and unifying API behavior with NTScalar.

This experience deepened my skills in full-stack development, asynchronous programming, and working at the intersection of software and hardware in a quantum computing environment.
