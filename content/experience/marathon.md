### Controls Software Engineer Intern

Starting in January 2026, I joined Marathon Fusion in San Francisco as a Controls Software Engineer Intern. Marathon Fusion develops next-generation fuel cycle technologies for fusion energy, including metal foil pumps and plasma centrifuges for tritium processing.

I proposed and implemented a full-stack PVAccess-based Python solution to replace LabVIEW, architecting a backend server, REST API gateway, and front-end UI to overhaul the laboratory's data acquisition and control systems.

I also develop controls software in LabVIEW and design and fabricate electrical control system hardware for plasma centrifuge experiments, enabling automated control of advanced plasma-based fuel processing systems.
