### Quantum Communication Researcher (Co-op)

• Self-directed optical fiber-based three-photon quantum interference experiments to calculate HOM dip visibility and JSI purity, with the aim of increasing fidelity of time-bin entangled qubits in GHZ state.


• Developed automated experimental procedures using self-written Python libraries using PyVISA and PySerial to shorten experiment run time from ~12 hours to ~2 hours by optimizing analysis and data collection processes.
